\title{Unofficial syllabus for math olympiads}
\author{Evan Chen}
\maketitle

Inspired by the \href{https://ioinformatics.org/files/ioi-syllabus-2019.pdf}
{syllabus for the IOI},
the purpose of this document is to give some guidance
on what sorts of topics could appear on math olympiads.

\section{Disclaimer}
\alert{This document is not official guidance},
rather a first approximation based upon one person's experience.
There is no promise that the International Math Olympiad,
much less any particular country's exams,
will follow this syllabus.
Many top countries at the IMO routinely use problems
which may demand more knowledge.
In addition, the content of IMO exam changes over time as well
(albeit gradually) and in ways that are arbitrary and not easily predictable.

This list is \emph{not} intended to be an exhaustive enumeration;
it highlights guidelines for the ``most common cases''
and is deliberately ambiguous about certain topics.

\section{Introduction}
Each topic is classified into one of the following categories.

\begin{description}
	\ii[\isRq\ Required]
	Topics in this category are prerequisite knowledge for solutions,
	and all contestants are expected to know them.

	\ii[\isUs\ Useful for solution]
	Topics in this category are often useful in solutions
	and contestants are encouraged to be familiar with this topic.
	However, when a solution is related to this topic,
	often there is a different solution using only ``required'' knowledge,
	or else the solution would be reasonable even to non-experts.
	Terms from these topics will typically not appear
	in problem statements without definition.
	Therefore, these topics are less important than topics marked as ``required''.

	\ii[\isAv\ Advanced topic]
	Topics in this area may be helpful (or occasionally even necessary)
	in more difficult problems on the IMO.
	However, beginners should prioritize learning
	other topics before this one.
	Concepts from this area will typically not appear in
	problem statements without definition.

	\ii[\isEx\ Not required]
	Contestants are not expected to know this topic.
	Problems in which knowledge of these areas
	gives a substantial advantage are rare at the IMO.
	They may still be applicable in some situations; however in this case
  an alternate solution often exists that at least
  nominally does not use these concepts.
  Team selection tests from high-performing countries
  may not necessarily respect this classification.
\end{description}

%\section{General}

In general, not much knowledge is demanded of contestants.
Problem statements are largely meant to be understandable even to those
without much formal training.
Topics usually covered in advanced undergraduate studies are often excluded.
Rather, the problems are somewhat meant to
test ingenuity and intuition rather than mere knowledge,
and often demand simple tools to be used in unexpected ways.

All students are expected to be fluent with mathematical proofs.
